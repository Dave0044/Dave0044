Hey! I'm David Rodriguez.

I'm a Cuban mathematician, with 4 years of research in Spain.

I'm currently working as a Research Mathematician at the Polytechnic University of Catalonia in Barcelona, Spain. I have been working for two years on a project called Biometric Cryptosystems for Post-Quantum Technologies, developing mathematical efficient algorithms implemented in C.

I have developed the GaloisFields repository by calling C functions from Python in a web project made with Django.

I am currently learning FastAPI.
